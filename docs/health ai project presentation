 Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: AI-Powered Health Monitoring System
Author: June Oyugi
Course: AI for Software Engineering
Date: November 27, 2025

---

 Slide 2: Abstract / Overview

 AI-powered system monitoring heart rate, SpO2, and activity.
 Detects anomalies using IsolationForest.
 Provides real-time actionable recommendations.

---

Slide 3: Problem Statement

 Continuous health monitoring is essential.
 Manual observation is impractical.
 Need an automated AI system.

---

 Slide 4: Objectives

 Monitor vital signs in real-time.
 Detect anomalies automatically.
 Provide recommendations via user interface.

---

 Slide 5: System Architecture Diagram

 Frontend (HTML/JS) → Backend (FastAPI) → AI Model (IsolationForest)
 Data flow arrows showing telemetry and prediction.

---

 Slide 6: Data Simulation

 Simulated heart rate, SpO2, activity level.
 Code snippet showing data generation.
 Placeholder for chart example.

---

 Slide 7: AI Model

 Algorithm: IsolationForest.
 Detects anomalies in telemetry data.
 Shows training pipeline and model saving.

---

 Slide 8: Backend (FastAPI)

 Serves static frontend.
 Exposes `/api/stream`, `/api/status`, `/api/train`, `/api/predict`.
 Handles requests and sends model results.

---

 Slide 9: API Endpoints Overview

 `/api/stream`: Live telemetry.
 `/api/status`: Backend & model status.
 `/api/train`: Retrain model.
 `/api/predict`: Predict anomalies.

---

 Slide 10: Frontend / Live Dashboard

 Displays live telemetry charts.
 Shows anomaly alerts.
 Polls backend endpoints.

---

 Slide 11: Telemetry Charts Example

 Placeholder screenshot of live chart (heart rate & SpO2).
 Code snippet showing dynamic update.

---

Slide 12: Anomaly Detection Alerts

 Cards pop up when anomalies detected.
 Color-coded indicators.
 Example snippet of status display.

---

 Slide 13: Testing & Validation

 Unit tests for backend & model.
 Integration tests for end-to-end flow.
 User simulation to trigger anomalies.

---

 Slide 14: Deployment

 Local: Uvicorn server.
 Optional cloud deployment (Docker + Azure/AWS).
 REST API endpoints available for clients.

---

 Slide 15: Challenges & Solutions

 OneDrive file locks → moved project folder.
 Data privacy → used simulated data.
 Model accuracy → fine-tuned parameters.
 Scalability → backend handles multiple users.

---

 Slide 16: Conclusion

 Fully functional AI-powered health monitoring prototype.
 Real-time anomaly detection & recommendations.
 Future work: real wearable integration, mobile app frontend.
