 Abstract

This project presents an AI-powered health monitoring system that collects and analyzes telemetry from wearable devices, detects anomalies in vital signs, and provides actionable health recommendations. Using a combination of Python, FastAPI, and machine learning (IsolationForest), the system demonstrates real-time health monitoring and a user-friendly interface.

 1. Introduction

Problem Statement: Individuals using wearable devices need a system that can monitor health metrics continuously and detect anomalies without manual intervention.

Objectives:

 Monitor heart rate, SpO2, and activity level in real-time.
 Detect anomalies using AI.
 Provide actionable recommendations through a user-friendly interface.

Significance: Early detection of abnormal health conditions can prevent medical emergencies and improve personal health awareness.

---

2. System Architecture

Overview: The system consists of three main components:

1. Frontend: Static UI displaying live telemetry.
2. Backend: FastAPI serving endpoints and processing data.
3. Model: IsolationForest trained to detect anomalies.

Data Flow Diagram:

```
User's Browser (Frontend)

  v

  |
  v
AI Model (IsolationForest) -> Returns Anomaly Status
```

3. Data Simulation and Preprocessing

Data Source: Simulated wearable telemetry.

Python Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = {
    'timestamp': pd.date_range(start='2023-10-01', periods=100, freq='T'),
    'heart_rate': np.random.randint(60, 100, 100),
    'blood_oxygen': np.random.randint(90, 100, 100),
    'activity_level': np.random.choice(['low', 'moderate', 'high'], 100)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Preprocessing: Normalization of heart rate and SpO2, encoding categorical activity levels.

---

4. AI Model

Algorithm: IsolationForest for anomaly detection.

Training Example:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
df['anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(df[['heart_rate', 'blood_oxygen']])
df['anomaly'] = df['anomaly'].apply(lambda x: 'Anomaly' if x == -1 else 'Normal')
```

Model Persistence: Saved to `backend/model/anomaly_model.pkl` for reuse.

---

 5. Backend (FastAPI)

Main Features:

 Serves frontend static files.
 Exposes endpoints for streaming, prediction, status, and training.

Endpoints:

 `/api/stream`: Returns simulated live telemetry.
 `/api/status`: Returns backend connection and model load status.
 `/api/train`: Retrains the IsolationForest model.
 `/api/predict`: Returns anomaly prediction.

Example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/api/status')
def status():
    return {'status': 'Backend running', 'model_loaded': True}
```

---

 6. Frontend

Features:

 Live charts for heart rate and SpO2.
 Anomaly alerts and notifications.
 Polls backend endpoints for telemetry updates.

Example (HTML/JS):

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
<div id="chart"></div>
<div id="alerts"></div>
```

**script.js** polls `/api/stream` and updates charts dynamically.

---

 7. Testing and Validation

Unit Testing: Individual components like data simulation, model prediction.

Integration Testing:** Frontend → Backend → Model.

Example:

 Open browser → check live chart updates.
 Trigger anomaly → alert card appears.

---

 8. Deployment

Local Deployment: Run FastAPI server with Uvicorn and access frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Cloud Deployment (Optional):

 Dockerize backend.
 Use Azure/AWS App Service for hosting.
 Expose endpoints as REST API.

---

 9. Challenges and Solutions

OneDrive file locks: Moved project outside OneDrive.
Data privacy: Simulated data used; real deployment must comply with HIPAA/GDPR.
Model accuracy: Use more data and fine-tune contamination parameter.
Scalability: Backend designed to handle multiple simultaneous users.

---

 10. Conclusion and Recommendations

 Functional AI-powered health monitoring prototype.
 Real-time telemetry visualization and anomaly detection.
 Future work: integrate real wearable device APIs, advanced predictive models, mobile app frontend.
